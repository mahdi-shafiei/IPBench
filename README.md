- 🔥 [2025-4-22] We release the codebase of IPBench.

## Introduction

Intellectual property, especially patents, shares similarities with academic papers in that it encapsulates the essence of domain knowledge across various technical fields. However, it is also governed by the intellectual property legal frameworks of different countries and regions. As such, it carries technical, legal, and economic significance, and is closely connected to real-world intellectual property services. In particular, intellectual property data is a rich, multi-modal data type with immense potential for content mining and analysis. Focusing on the field of intellectual property, we propose a comprehensive four-level IP task taxonomy based on the DOK model. Building on this taxonomy, we developed IPBench, a large language model benchmark consisting of 10,374 data instances across 20 tasks and covering 8 types of IP mechanisms. Compared to existing related benchmarks, IPBench features the largest data scale and the most comprehensive task coverage, spanning technical and legal tasks as well as understanding, reasoning, classification, and generation tasks.

## Dataset Creation

To bridge the gap between real-world demands and the application of LLMs in the IP field, we introduce the first comprehensive IP task taxonomy. Our taxonomy is based on Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) Theory and is extended to include four hierarchical levels: Information Processing, Logical Reasoning, Discriminant Evaluation, and Creative Generation. It includes an evaluation of models' intrinsic knowledge of IP, along with a detailed analysis of IP text from both point-wise and pairwise perspectives, covering technical and legal aspects.

Building on this taxonomy, we develop **IPBench**, the first comprehensive Intellectual Property Benchmark for LLMs, consisting of 10,374 data points across 20 tasks aimed at evaluating the knowledge and capabilities of LLMs in real-world IP applications.

This holistic evaluation enables us to gain a hierarchical deep insight into LLMs, assessing their capabilities in in-domain memory, understanding, reasoning, discrimination, and creation across different IP mechanisms. Due to the legal nature of the IP field, there are regional differences between countries. Our IPBench is constrained within the legal frameworks of the United States and mainland China, making it a bilingual benchmark.

## Installation
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference

We provide the inference code using either vLLM or the OpenAI API in the *src* folder, along with corresponding run scripts in the *scripts* folder.
```
sh inference.sh

sh inference-api.sh

sh inference-fewshot.sh

sh inference-cot.sh
```

## Evaluation

We provide separate evaluation code for MCQA, Classification, and Generation tasks in the *eval* folder, along with corresponding run scripts in the *scripts* folder.
```
sh eval-mcqa.sh

sh eval-3-5.sh

sh eval-classification.sh

sh eval-generation.sh
```
